The Datasaurus Dozen is a modern adaptation of Anscombe's Quartet. The Datasaurus dataset was originally proposed by Alberto Cairo to emphasis the importance of visualising data [link](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html). It was extended to the Datasaurus Dozen dataset and published on [CHI'17](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3025912). The dataset and its description is available via [this link](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs).

 1. Download the dataset using [this link](https://www.autodesk.com/content/dam/autodesk/www/autodesk-reasearch/Publications/pdf/The%20Datasaurus%20Dozen.zip), and plot all 13 datasets with scatter plots in a 4 x 4 grid.
 2. Use the blank spaces of the 4 x 4 grid with plots of your choice to illustrate that whilst these datasets are indistinguishable by summary statistics, each dataset has its own distribution pattern.
