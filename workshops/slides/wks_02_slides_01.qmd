## Base R Functions

This worksheet focuses on the use of functions in the stats package (base R) related to standard probability distributions. These functions come in four variants, each with a different prefix:

- `d`: Density function (probability mass function for discrete distributions)
- `p`: Cumulative distribution function
- `q`: Quantile function
- `r`: Random generation function 

For example, for the normal distribution, the functions are:

- `dnorm()`: Density function
- `pnorm()`: Cumulative distribution function
- `qnorm()`: Quantile function
- `rnorm()`: Random generation function

See `?Distributions` for the full list of distributions and their corresponding function names.
