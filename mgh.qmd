# MGH module matters {.unnumbered}

- Why is this the first module of the course?
  - All technical work of the course is taught and examined in R
  - **Practice** repeatedly as you progress through the course
- Why R?
  - Use what others use
  - Rich set of packages
  - Relatively gentle learning curve
  - Interactive environment
  - Computers are cheaper than people
- I have many programming languages on my CV, can I skip this module?
  - How to write `a <- 1` in your language of choice?[^2]
- At the end of the week
  - Know what can be done in R
  - Know how to learn more about R
  - Have compiled your own R cheat sheet
- Limitations
  - 30 hours of R from this module
  - This is only the first 5% of what R can do.
  - More practice in your own time

[^2]: If your answer is `a = 1` for Python, or `int a = 1;` for C/C++, then you should not skip this module.

R will start to make more sense as the week goes on.

Don't just listen and read. Type and execute all the `code` you see in the lectures **at least once on your own computer**.
